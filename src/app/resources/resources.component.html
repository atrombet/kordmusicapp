              The Nashville Number System (NNS) is a method of transcribing music that uses numbers to
              denote the seven scale degrees of a major scale. The system has many benefits including:

                Consider the C Major scale: C D E F G A B (C).
                Since this is the C Major scale we call C the "root".
                There are seven scale degrees of the major scale before reaching the octave of the root (shown in parentheses).
                NNS maps each of these scale degrees to a number like such:
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <img class="resources__chart" src="../../assets/resources_page/nns_notes_chart.png">
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                For example, if the lead line of song was "4 5 3 1" this would be played in the key of C as "F G E C".
                In this case, selecting an octave to voice the notes would be up to the musician's discretion.
              </div>

              <div class="resources__subtopicHeader row">chords</div>
              <div class="row">
                The numbers also apply to the basic chords of a key. Continuing with our C Major example:
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                nns_chords_chart
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                In this way we can use numbers to represent the chord with its root on a particular scale degree in the desired key.
                For instance, to play the 4 chord in the key of C, one would play the chord that starts on the 4 note of the
                C Major scale (F) resulting in an F Major chord.
                Note in the table above a minus sign (-) next to the chord indicates a minor chord.

              <div class="row">
                NNS can also be used to denote inversions of a chord.
                The following chart contains the 7 most common chords used in a huge variety of modern Pop, Country, and Rock music.
              </div>
              <div class="row">

              <div class="row">
                The slash (/) denotes a chord inversion.
                The number under the slash indicates the bass voicing.
                In the table above there are two inversions.
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                The first is the 1/3 chord.
                This is a 1 chord with a bass voicing of 3.
                In the key of C that equates to a C Major chord with an E note as the root.
                On the bass guitar, only an 3 (E) note would be played for this inversion.
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                The same principle is applied to the 5/7 chord.
                In C this is G Major with a B root or bass voicing.
                Bass guitar only plays the 7 (B) note.

                This is what makes NNS such a great tool for transposing music.
